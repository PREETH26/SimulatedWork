# Portfolio

This is a modern, interactive personal portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It features a stylish glassmorphism hero section, smooth navigation, responsive design, and animated section reveals.

## What I Built

- **Modern UI:** Clean, glassmorphism-inspired hero section with a gradient background and centered profile image.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **Navigation:** Sticky navbar with smooth scrolling to About, Skills, and Projects sections.
- **Section Focus:** When a navbar link is clicked, the corresponding section expands to fill the viewport for focused reading.
- **Animated Reveal:** Sections fade in as you scroll for a dynamic, engaging experience.
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS (custom properties, flexbox, grid, glassmorphism), and vanilla JavaScript.

## Prompts Used with Copilot

- "Build me a modern UI based portfolio that's super and marvelous."
- "Use js and css."
- "Make the design occupy the entirety of the device's space and also make it look good and also responsive."
- "Change the design as it just looks like it is zoomed and not at all fitting the entirety of the screen."
- "Change the entire design as it doesn't look good and I meant to occupy the screen and not just zoom it."
- "Make it more stylish, modern, and interactive."
- "See the image, my hero part is not proper. Improve and change the design and I like the glass touch."
- "I want my photo part at the center and change the design."
- "See my css and then add more spacing and make it more aesthetic."
- "Please do not change the design but when I click on skills and reach skills only that should be visible even though the content inside it is less, but when viewing normally there shouldn't be a huge space and it should also work for about and projects also."
- "Give me a README for this project showing what I have done using Copilot and what prompts I have used and what concepts and code I have used."

## Concepts and Code Used

- **Glassmorphism:** Used for hero and section backgrounds with `backdrop-filter`, transparency, and soft box-shadows.
- **Responsive Layout:** Flexbox and grid for adaptive layouts; media queries for mobile optimization.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** JavaScript and CSS for smooth navigation between sections.
- **Section Focus:** JavaScript toggles a `.focused` class to expand sections on navbar click.
- **Fade-in Animation:** JavaScript and CSS for scroll-triggered fade-in effects.
